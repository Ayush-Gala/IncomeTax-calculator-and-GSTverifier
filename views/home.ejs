        <h2 class="fade-in-up">Benefits of Paying Tax on Time</h2>
        <ul class="fade-in-up">
            <li>Taxes fund public infrastructure and services. For example, in India, the country spends the highest
                proportion of its GDP on public infrastructure and services, as compared to other emerging economies.
                With a
                year-on-year rise in capex of more than 35% and a targeted infrastructure investment of more than Rs 10
                lakh
                crore in Budget 2022-23, the Union government has reaffirmed its commitment to utilize infrastructure as
                a
                force multiplier for long-term economic growth.</li>
            <li>Taxes are also used for social development and welfare programs. For example, the government of India
                allocates
                a substantial amount of revenue, about 6% of GDP, for various social development and welfare programs,
                including
                public health and nutrition, education, and rural development programs.</li>
            <li>Taxes fund education. For example, in India, where illiteracy is a major problem, the government needs a
                lot of
                money to provide quality education; not only in urban areas but up to the grass root levels. This
                includes public
                and private expenditure on education, including spending on school infrastructure, teachers' salaries,
                and
                research, development and innovation.</li>

        <h2 class="fade-in-up">Ways to Save Tax in India</h2>
        <p class="fade-in-up">
            There are several legitimate ways to save tax in India, such as investing in tax-saving instruments like
            Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), and National Savings Certificate (NSC).
            Additionally, one can claim deductions on expenses like house rent, medical insurance, and education loans.

        <h2 class="fade-in-up">Challenges with GST</h2>
        <p class="fade-in-up">
            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold for domestic
            consumption. The GST is paid by consumers, but it is remitted to the government by the businesses selling
            the goods and services. The introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on July 1, 2017, replaced multiple
            indirect taxes and aimed to create a unified market in India.
            However, the GST implementation has been a challenge for many businesses, especially small and medium
            enterprises (SMEs).
        </p>
        <h3 class="fade-in-up">Challenges with False GST payments</h3>
        <ul class="fade-in-up">
            <li>
                Exploitation by businesses charging false GST, undermining the integrity of the GST system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of consumer awareness about applicable GST rates, making them susceptible to false GST charges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Difficulty in verifying GST charges on bills, leaving consumers vulnerable to potential exploitation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fade-in-up">
            Addressing these challenges requires effective consumer protection measures to raise awareness, enforce
            penalties, and combat fraudulent practices. Our OCR-Aided GST Invoice Verification Software is a solution
            designed to address the challenges associated with false GST payments and ensure accuracy in invoicing.
            Leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, this software aims to provide businesses and
            consumers with a robust and efficient tool for verifying GST charges on invoices.
